  - **Conjur Account**: The organization account assigned during Conjur appliance installation. If you are using a hosted Conjur instance for a proof of concept, the Account is typically your email address.  

  - **Conjur Appliance URL**: The URL of the Conjur appliance that you are connecting to.

  - **Conjur Login**: The username of a Conjur user. 
  
  The user ID must have update and create privileges on the root Conjur policy. This login is only used to add and remove hosts from the Conjur policy files as your applications are deployed to or removed from PCF. 
  
  

  - **Conjur API Key**: The API Key of the Conjur user whose username you have provided in the **Conjur Login** field. 

  If the user's API key changes, you need to update this field and click **Apply Changes** to continue using the Service Broker to bind applications. After binding, an application has its own credentials for connecting to the Conjur appliance.        

NOTE: The Conjur user credentials configured here are available only to PCF admins.  They are not generally accessible to users in PCF.
